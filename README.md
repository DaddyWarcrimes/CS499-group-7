# Truckr, database for transportaion companies.

This is a CS499 senior project; we got a B.

This is not production software and should not be used in the wild. I'm maintaining it as an example for others.

Project is based on the Django framework using a sqlite3 DBMS.

All employees for test data have password 'groupseven'.
